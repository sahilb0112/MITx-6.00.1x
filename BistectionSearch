#Exercise: guess my number
#In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!
#The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). 
#The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? 
#Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!

print("Please think of a number between 0 and 100!")
low = 0; 
high = 100;
user_response = ''

while(user_response != 'c'):
    guess = int((low+high)/2)
    print ("Is your secret number " + str(guess) + "?")
    user_response = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")
    if (user_response == 'l' or user_response == 'h' or user_response == 'c'):
        if(user_response == 'c') :
            print("Game over. Your secret number was: " + str(guess))
        elif(user_response == 'l'):
            low = guess
        elif(user_response == 'h'):
            high = guess      
    else:
        print ("Sorry, I did not understand your input.")
